This is a starter/helper base built on top of  [Create Inferno App](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app).

Getting Started: 
```
git clone https://github.com/funki-chicken/inferno-storm
cd inferno-storm
npm i 
npm run start 
```

And finally, open http://localhost:3000

There's more info when you open it in your browser.
If this is code that seems useful to others, I will work on a more comprehensive readme.
